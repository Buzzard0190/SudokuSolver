Description:
  Sudoku puzzle solver that uses backtracking.
  Before backtracking the program attempts to 
  reduce the search space by solving for some 
  of the numbers by located "naked singles" as 
  described at 
      http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Naked_Candidates
  For more on the backtracking algorithm see the
  following video:

Building
  The source is in written in C++11 and requires
  a C++ compiler of recent vintage (g++ 4.7 or later,
  clang++). The provided Makefile will automate
  the build via "make" (use -O3 in CPPFLAGS for best performace).

         make         # builds 'solvesudoku' app
         make clean   # deletes build riffraff

Running:
  The program reads a 81 character string from stdin
  that describes the input puzzle in row-major order.
  Each character in the string is either a dot '.' or
  a digit for an empty space or initial number respectively.
  I have include two files 'simple.txt' and 'hard.txt'
  which contain a variety of sample puzzles.
  For example, to run the program using the 13th puzzle
  from "hard.txt", do the following:

        sed -n "13p" hard.txt | ./solvesudoku 

  The program will "pretty print" the original puzzle,
  puzzle with deduced numbers, and then the final
  solved puzzle. Puzzles should take no more than 30 sec
  to solve on a machine of recent vintage.

  To solve all the problems in 'hard.txt' you can use
  the provided Perl script:

       ./solve.pl hard.txt

GitLab Continuous Integration (CI)
 
   There is a .gitlab-ci.yml provided for trigger CI on
   git push to gitlab server. This runs the scripts build.pl
   and test.pl using a (modern) gcc environment.
